# MongoScraper
## Node.js app built with MongoDB/Mongoose, Cheerio, Express

#### This application scrapes articles from https://www.theonion.com/c/news-in-brief using Cheerio and displays each article's title, link, and summary. Scraped articles are stored in a database using MongoDB/Mongoose, and the user can save articles to a Saved page to revisit later. The user can add a note to an article, edit the note, and if I ever come back to this and get it working they will be able to delete a note from an article.
